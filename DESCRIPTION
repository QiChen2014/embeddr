Description: Embeddr provides a set of methods for manifold learning on single-cell data followed by principal curve fitting to assign a pseudotime to cells. It starts with normalised single-cell RNA-seq and reduces the dimension using Laplacian Eigenmaps before tracing through the centre of the manifold using principal curves.
